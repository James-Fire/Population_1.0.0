*Used up to make science and some select things.
*Need food, water, and energy to rest
*Need food, water, and energy to make children.
Produce sewage. Treating sewage gives fertilizer
*Fertilizer can be used to increase farm yield.
*Farms are furnaces, which means each food type needs a unique entity.
*Wood farming, to supply wood for housing and paper.
*Children need food, water, and energy to grow up
*Improved recipes to get more science per person
*Houses are furnaces that take in food and tired people. Variations for using electric, thermal
*Food is "premade meals" with a variety of recipes to make it. Packaging must be made and dealt with. Paper, Plastic, Aluminum, Iron.
People stack up to 2.
*Providing "entertainment" makes "rest" go faster.
*Pollution causes houses to work slower, like homeworld farms.
*Food made from a greater variety of ingredients increases rest speed.
*Houses come in various sizes. Single-Family are the least space efficient, but do rest slightly faster. Apartment towers rest many people,
but do so slightly slower.
*Population gets tired over time, even if they're not working?
*Vertical Farming to be more space-efficient, but does require input resources. Also divorces food production from land quality

TODO
Plant Oil needs a use
Should probably be able to turn any farming products into organic material or fertilizer
Alternate construction recipes?
Farms and housing need to account for pollution
Farms and housing need to be updated every so often
Entertainment somehow?
Vertical Farming? Hydroponics?
Need a source of fertilizer that isn't based on farms. Sulfur + Stone?
Fix pop recipes giving copper plates instead of recycling
Switch housing negatives to being compared to positives
Localisation, if gameplay turns out good.
Art, if gameplay good.


DESIGN IDEA

Trip generation dependency between multiple centers, to give reason to build and use efficient rail networks.

Over time, you devote more resources to people, either through a sort of Happiness mechanic where they demand better living conditions over time,
or as part of a general "use more resources to be more population efficient".

Using low density housing would require significant infrastructure and ongoing resource investment to make work, but would be rewarded
with needing less population to do the same work
